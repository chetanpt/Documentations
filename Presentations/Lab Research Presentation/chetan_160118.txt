Å[Muscle Force Estimation for Personalized Musculoskeletal ModelÅ]

Å[Progress of studyÅ]
1. Learning opensim and its functions
2. Able to find muscle force and activation 
3. Learning oensim API for programming muscle model.

Å[AchievementÅ]
Å1. Provide external strength to the model and find the effects of it of muscle force and activation. 
2. Ability to build customised model using programs

[Problem untill next timeÅ]
1. Fix the model and external force to generate less strength. 
2. Develop tool to build personalised muscuoskeletal model 

------------------------------------------------------------
Å[Questions and answersÅ]
Q1. How muscle force and activation is different ?
Ans: Muscle force si unit is Newton whereas unit of muscle activation is percentage.
Q2. Why did you use these two factors ?
Ans: Because when using assistive muscle the muscle force and activation are used to find out the effects of the external force. 
Q3. What are the names of two muscle in the graph and where are they located ?
Ans. Sartorius and Rectus Femoris of right leg. Endpoints of these muscle starts from hip till knee. 
Q4. Which motion is used for the experiment ?
Ans. Normal Walk motion is used. 

Å[ComentsÅ]
[Prof. Tsuji]
C1. Need originality of the research topic. No two research topic can be same. 

[Prof. Kurita]
C1. Walking is harder if muscle are generating more force. 


Å[Challenges for the futureÅ]
Å1. Develop a software which will find musce force and activation for external force without much changes.
